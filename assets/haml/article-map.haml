PCPC is a large, extended family of people seeking to be Christ’s disciples and to bear His truth into our world. That commitment is expressed in our Purpose — that we exist to extend the transforming presence of the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ in Dallas and to the world. All are welcome, if you’re brand new to the Christian faith, trying to figure out what it’s all about, or if you’ve been a follower of Christ for some time, we would love for you to join us on a Sunday morning.

Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.”

                            %p To say that we are evangelical means that we take our stand with all those who believe in what used to be called “the fundamentals”: the existence of the triune God, the deity of Jesus, the virgin birth, and substitutionary and vicarious atonement of Christ, the physical resurrection of Christ, the sure return of Christ, and the infallibility and divine authority of the Bible which is a faithful and true guide to what we are to believe and how we are to live. We joyfully affirm our unity with those from every tradition and denomination who hold to these fundamentals including those true believers in Christ who, for whatever reasons, find themselves members of denominations or churches with which we might have certain disagreements.
